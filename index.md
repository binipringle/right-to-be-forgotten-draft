excerpt: "The right to be forgotten should be a human right"

The right to be forgotten is a fundamental right protected in Europe by the General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR). A version of this right is protected under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). More expansive protection of the right to be forgotten has been proposed in New York through New York State Senate Assembly Bill A5323 (2017-2018 Legislative Session). This paper will discuss why the right to be forgotten should be protected, why California law does not go as far as European law in protecting this right, and whether the proposed New York law can guarantee more protections than California law in protecting our right to be forgotten.
