On September 24, 2019, the Court of Justice of the European Union (“the Court”) held that the “right to be forgotten” does not require a search engine to de-list search results on all of its domains. However, a search engine operator is still required to de-list search results on domains for all of the European Union (“EU”) Member States. The ruling left the referring court, the Conseil d’État (“the Conseil”), to apply the Court’s holding to Google’s practices in France.
