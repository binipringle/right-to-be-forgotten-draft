The CCPA is a state statute intended to enhance privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California, United States. The bill was passed by the California State Legislature and signed into law on June 28, 2018. The intentions of the Act are to provide California residents with the right to:

1. Know what personal data is being collected about them.
2. Know whether their personal data is sold or disclosed and to whom.
3. Say no to the sale of personal data.
4. Access their personal data.
5. Request a business to delete any personal information about a consumer collected from that consumer.[10]
6. Not be discriminated against for exercising their privacy rights.

Key differences between CCPA and Europe's GDPR include scope and territorial reach, definitions related to protected information, levels of specificity, and an opt-out right for sales of personal information (CCPA has this while GDPR doesn't, but arguably protects personal data from being used for marketing purposes in other ways). CCPA differs in definition of personal information from GDPR as in some cases the CCPA only considers data that was provided by a consumer. The GDPR does not make that distinction and covers all personal data regardless of source. CCPA does not protect sensitive personal information if the information was manifestly made public by the data subject themselves. As such, the definition in GDPR is much broader than defined in the CCPA.
