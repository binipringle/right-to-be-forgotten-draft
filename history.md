  Individuals should have the right to "determine the development of their life in an autonomous way, without being perpetually or periodically stigmatized as a consequence of a specific action performed in the past." - Alessandro Mantelero, Professor of Law
excerpt: "The digital amalgam of our lives makes us appear wholly knowable and therefore, condemnable."

In Europe, the intellectual roots of the right to be forgotten can be found in French law, which recognizes _le droit à l’oubli_ — a right that allows a person formerly convicted of a criminal offense who has served their time to object to the publication of the facts of their conviction and incarceration. Thus, the right to be forgotten is premised on the potential for rehabilitation - the idea that privacy allows us to fully evolve as individuals because it prevents others from digging up the digital memory of our past transgressions.

In the United States, by contrast, publication of someone’s criminal history is protected by the First Amendment. Although the word "privacy" is actually never used in the text of the United States Constitution, there are Constitutional limits to the government's intrusion into individuals' right to privacy. The Constitution, however, only protects against state actors. Invasions of privacy by individuals can only be remedied under previous court decisions.
